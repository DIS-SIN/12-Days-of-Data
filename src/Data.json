The Government of Canada generates and holds a vast amount and diverse array of data, including spatial data, operational data, transactional service data, and data collected from or about citizens and businesses.\n\nThrough the power of data, public servants can fundamentally transform governments by changing the way they operate, make decisions and deliver services.
